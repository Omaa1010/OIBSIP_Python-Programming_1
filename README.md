# OIBSIP_Python-Programming_1
📌 Project Objective

The objective of this project is to develop a Random Password Generator using Python.

The application generates secure passwords based on user-defined criteria such as:

Password length

Character types (letters, numbers, symbols)

This project demonstrates:

Randomization techniques

Input validation

GUI development using Tkinter

Basic security principles for strong password creation

🛠 Tools and Technologies Used

Python 3

Tkinter – GUI development

Random Module – Generating random characters

String Module – Handling character sets

🧱 Project Structure

The application includes:

GUI Interface for:

Password length input

Character type selection (Letters, Numbers, Symbols)

Excluding specific characters

Password generation logic

Password strength indicator

Clipboard integration

⚙️ Steps Performed
1️⃣ GUI Design

Designed a simple and user-friendly interface using Tkinter

Added input field for password length

Included checkboxes for selecting character types

Added buttons for generating and copying the password

Displayed a password strength indicator

2️⃣ Random Password Generation

Used the random module to select characters randomly

Used the string module to access:

Uppercase and lowercase letters

Digits

Special characters

Combined selected character sets based on user preferences

3️⃣ Input Validation

Ensured password length is a valid number

Enforced minimum length requirement

Required at least one character type to be selected

Handled invalid inputs using error messages

4️⃣ Security Rules Implementation

Ensured at least one character from each selected type is included

Added password strength indicator based on:

Length

Inclusion of letters

Inclusion of numbers

Inclusion of symbols

5️⃣ Clipboard Integration

Implemented copy-to-clipboard functionality

Allowed users to quickly copy generated passwords

🔄 How the Application Works

User enters desired password length

User selects character types (letters, numbers, symbols)

(Optional) User excludes specific characters

Application generates a random password

Password strength is displayed

User can copy the password to clipboard

✅ Key Features

Customizable password length

Multiple character type selection

Character exclusion option

Password strength indicator

Clipboard copy feature

Error handling and validation

Clean and simple GUI

🚀 Outcome

The final outcome is a functional and user-friendly Password Generator application that creates secure and customizable passwords.

This project successfully combines:

Beginner-level programming concepts (randomization and input handling)

Intermediate-level GUI development

Basic security implementation principles
